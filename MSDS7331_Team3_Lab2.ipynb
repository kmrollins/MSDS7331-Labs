    "The two classification tasks for our 2017 census dataset are to predict whether a given census tract has a high or a low unemployment rate, as well as a high or low child poverty rate, based on other relevant factors. This is an important task, as it enables certain areas to be flagged as needing economic development or aid. Below, we first prepared our data for classification by cleaning it (in the same way as Lab 1), as well as removing unnecessary and redundant variables."

Our target variables are \"HighUnemployment\" and \"HighChildPoverty\", which we encoded so that 1 signifies a tract with a high unemployment rate or high child poverty rate and a 0 indicates low unemployment or low child poverty respectively. We created the cutoff between high and low unemployment to be 6 percent, which was the median value for the unemployment attribute. Similarly, we used the median value of 16.3 as the cutoff for high and low child poverty rates. By using the median to separate the groups, the classes will be of roughly the same size.\n",

Here we eliminate variables based on the pairwise correlation plot we created in Lab 1 and intuition. In the Mini Lab, we further reduced the dataset down to only 6 important features based on PCA, but the models using that dataset were not as accurate. Thus we will use this \"full\" dataset of 28 variables throughout this lab.\n",

    "Accuracy is already a good metric for our dataset, because there is no class imbalance. We have defined our target class variables to be split such that half of the observations are considered to have high unemployment and half have low unemployment, and similarly for child poverty. Problems often arise using accuracy when there is large class imbalance, but if a classifier tried to predict the same class for all observations in our dataset, it would only attain 50% accuracy. Thus if we see accuracies much higher than 50%, this is a good indication that the models are performing well.\n",

If a model attains high precision, i.e. there are few false positives, this means that the model did not flag many census tracts that actually had low unemployment or child poverty as ones needing aid. High precision would be good for an organization that has limited resources, i.e. they can only help so many neighborhoods, so they want to make sure the ones they target are actually in need of economic development or aid.\n",
