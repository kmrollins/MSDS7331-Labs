    "**Purpose of data set:**\n",
    "The Census Bureau presents census data from the entire United States including Puerto Rico and District of Columbia. The data consists of 5 year estimates from the 2017 American Community Survey. The data set contains 37 variables that measure features such as socio-economic status, race, and sex, and is produced for all counties. The data for the census was collected to have information on population distributions for the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm effectiveness:**\n",
    "Our intentions for the data set are to be able to accurately predict unemployment rates and child poverty rates. If we can predict them, then we can see what variables contribute to an accurate prediction. Knowing what factors are associated with unemployment and child poverty can create a basis for what things can be changed to lower unemployment and child poverty. A good prediction algorithm will have a prediction accuracy of at least 80%. Because the data covers the whole United States, it is important to make accurate predictions so that those trying to bring about change can effectively and efficiently utilize resources in places where they are most needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation method and metrics:**\n",
    "To test and validate our models, we will use a stratified shuffle split to divide our data into training and testing sets. Stratification is appropriate for our dataset as a precautionary measure. Our target binary class variables of unemployment and child poverty are already split close to 50/50, but using stratification ensures that this ratio is maintained and not skewed by random chance. In addition, we will use a 80/20 train/test split because we have a fairly large amount of data (70k+ observations). For large datasets, is it appropriate to use a smaller percentage for the test set because there is still plenty to test on, whereas a smaller dataset might necessitate a 60/40 or even a 50/50 train/test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary evaluation metric we will use for our classification tasks is accuracy, but we will examine precision and recall as well. Accuracy is already a good metric for our dataset, because there is no class imbalance. We will define our target class variables to be split such that half of the observations are considered to have high unemployment and half have low unemployment, and we will make a similar split for child poverty. Thus if we see accuracies much higher than 50%, this is a good indication that the models are performing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision and recall are also helpful to us based on the people who might be using these models. If a model attains high precision, i.e. there are few false positives, this means that the model did not flag many census tracts that actually had low unemployment or child poverty as ones needing aid. High precision would be good for an organization that has limited resources, i.e. they can only help so many neighborhoods, so they want to make sure the ones they target are actually in need of economic development or aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if a model has high recall, i.e. there are few false negatives, this means that when census tracts have high unemployment or child poverty the model correctly identifies them. This would be appropriate for an organization that has extensive resources that wants to aid in all areas that need it, or at least identify/flag all of those areas for future development. Therefore we will look at accuracy, precision and recall for our classification tasks."

    "Before jumping into analysis, it is important for us to verify the quality of our data. After importing various libraries and our dataset, we first verified that there were no duplicates by checking the uniqueness of the TractID field. Because this field was stated to be an identifier for each geographic area of the census, we assumed that there would be no duplicates; we confirmed this to be safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also viewed missing values occuring in each column. Upon investigation, we found that many NaNs were occuring because several tracts had a population of 0, leading to invalid percentages for other variables. These missing values were not mistakes in the data, because it is possible for census tracts to be unpopulated. However, it does not make sense to predict poverty or unemployment rates for empty areas, so we chose to remove these observations. To deal with the remaining missing values, we performed imputation to the median, some aggregated over another variable. We favored the median over the mean because the median is not heavily influenced by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to identify potential outliers we looked at summary statistics of our numeric variables. While it is difficult to detect outliers in such a high-dimensional space, in this way we could identify out of the ordinary minimums and maximums, especially with so many percentage attributes. For instance, if a percentage variable had a minimum less than 0 or maximum greater than 100, this would certainly have been an error in the data. We did not observe any mistakes such as this, and we felt that the non-percentage variables had reasonable statistics as well. Therefore we did not remove any outliers."

Our models, specifically the Random Forest models for predicting unemployment and child poverty, achieved decent accuracy levels. We would count it a success if the use of our models led those organizations to aid significantly more neighborhoods than they were before using our models, because they were able to more successfully identify areas in need through our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of deploying our model would be somewhat dependent on the organization we were deploying it for. This is because they may want to use our models to predict unemployment or child poverty on their own data, but they may not have as many predictor variables as we used to train our models. Thus we would trim down our training sets and models based on the data we knew would be coming in. Beyond this, however, deploying our models might involve setting up a server and then setting up endpoints so that the company could make API requests to predict data points individually or in batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option might be to use an existing service such as Deep Cognition (reference below) to host our models. This would require additional research and possibly more expenses, but would likely require less technical knowledge of setting up a server, endpoints, etc. which might be a limiting factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source of our data from was only a subset of the available attributes recorded by the U.S. government. We could retrieve additional features to make the deployed models even more generalized to the data that interested parties might have. In addition, the models should be updated every few years (say, every 5-10 years) to remain current. This works well with the U.S. census data that we trained our models on, since they are taken every 10 years but yearly estimates are published as well."
